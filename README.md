# Transcriptomics_crash_course
Booklet, data and code for the Transcriptomics crash course hosted at CEES April 2015
It is a crash course in de novo transcriptomics for complete beginners without any prior knowledge of big data, 
big data bioinformatics, UNIX, computing clusters and so forth. I have choosen the Trinity pipeline as an example 
with simple downstream analyses using common R-packages like DEseq and edgeR. The booklet is written in a down to earth 
simple language, the steps are presented stripped of any advanced user settings, the statistics are not explained in 
detail, but in a general context to help the novice user in selecting correct settings. The aim of this course is to
get the novice user "up and walking" - the running is for later.
